* BubbleSortWithAndWithoutRecursion - A program which includes the algorithm working recursively
* MergeArray - A program which sorts two arrays into one combined array
* MergeSort - A program which sorts an array by applying a dividing and conquering algorithm
* BinaryTree - A program which sorts an array through Binary Tree sorting algorithm
* SortProject - A program which amalgamates and tests the efficiency of each the sorting programs, this is done by utilising interfaces
* PalindromeWithExceptions - A program which returns true if a word is a palindrome and creates an exception if provided with an empty string
* BubbleSortWithGenerics - A Bubble Sort program with the implementation of generics to allow the testing of multiple wrapper-type arrays
